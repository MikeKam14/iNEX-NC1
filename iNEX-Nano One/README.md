#  iNEX
## by: Michael Kam (C4S2 Participant)

### Appreciation Words from the Author
--> Hello, my name is Michael Kam, a student participant at Apple Developer Academy C4S2. I am an industrial engineering student at 8th semester and currently I am working on my thesis. I would like to give my deepest gratitude for you, who is willing to download the project and read through this message. The objective for the application distribution through GitHub is because I needed certain respondents to help give their feedbacks about my project on Nano Challenge 1. My developer account has not been approved yet by Apple Inc so I cannot use TestFlight to distribute the app.

### About my Thesis
--> My thesis covers the topic about user satisfaction by using User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) and therefore I needed about 67 respondents to help me generate data for the thesis. Whoever you are that helps on my data gathering, I am wishing grand luck upon you, and may your life be blessed and fortunes fall upon you.  


### App Description
--> iNEX is an app to help track personal user's expenses and incomes with simple and intuitive process in mind. iNEX was made because the Author wants to increase financial literacy and discipline for teenage who have just started generate their own money. It also align with the main objective of NC1 where every student participant must generate one app according to his/her story.


### Disclaimers
-> The time filter function has not been integrated.
-> Settings page function has not been integrated.
-> No data persistence, simply because the Author's lacking skill in programming.


### Instructions
--> Please build and run the project on iPhone 12 (not Pro, Mini, or Max) because the project does not use any Auto Layout features. Using other phone will result in size constraints to differ.
--> Please fill the UEQ for the first time, where the first one covers your EXPECTATIONS about the app after reading the app's description.
--> After testing through the app, fill the UEQ for the second time, where the second one covers your ACTUAL EXPERIENCE (PERFORMANCE) of using the app.

### Reason for twice feedback
--> There are many methods used in the thesis, where some of them requires two-times feedback for comparison, see below:
--> 1. Validity and Reliability Test .
--> 2. Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA), the method needs your expectations rating and actual performances rating. IPA usually known as GAP Analysis.
--> 3. Quality-Function Deployment, last used to propose solution to the app based on IPA Analysis.
